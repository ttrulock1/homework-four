Okay, all content, explanation, coding, solid questions, with a little style. What I mean is I totally focused on building the quiz game (with all the requirements, the timer, the high scores table (with all the requirements), etc. I focused on the making helpful comments for both me and the grader. This was something my previous code for these homeworks did not do well. I made a point to do a better job at this and was happy with my comments this time. The comments in the code work. This was the most challenging homework to date by far, but I completed every task(requirement) and learned more making this timed quiz than any of the previous homeworks.
 
Things to note. High Score has a top ten (that displays at the end of the quiz and fulfills those requirements.) Timer counts down when button is pressed with a time deduction for every wrong answer. There is a place to enter initials. There is fun quiz based on famous guitarists consisting of 10 questions. 

Finally, application works with no errors.

Other notes. Button click after initials enters starts quiz; when question is answered then the next question is presented; when the game is over then the game is over.

Also: Application resembles mock up functionality, interface style is clean enough and polished enough,(and time was put into making a good quiz.);

Additional notes about github, etc.: Readme (this document) completed; files cleanly uploaded to Github; ;  Repository has clear name, multiple descriptive commits messages, follows best practices in naming, etc.; Both URLs are functional and sent to bootcampspot.
